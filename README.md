# PressReads
# Problem Statement
To build an AI/ML based solution that generates short 
summaries of press releases for easy and more targeted dissemination of 
information to the people. Such a TL,DR (Too Long, Didnâ€™t Read) 
software may be integrated in an app-based solution.
# Problem Description
With the reducing attention span of the audience, citizens are increasingly looking for authentic information in the fastest possible manner. In this regard, an AI based solution may be developed which, on receiving a press release as input, provides 50-60 word short summaries and key highlights of a press release. The short summaries may be finally vetted by the concerned PIB official before dissemination. For this purpose, appropriate training may be given through the existing database of press releases and the available solutions in the market. In future, such key highlights may be automatically converted into attractive infographics with the integration of a designing software with the TLDR software.
# Proposed Solution

text.  
Provide user with link to website with summarized and verified
press releases.  
Integrate with translation tool to provide translated summaries.
